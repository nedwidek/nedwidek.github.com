          	<p>Community Home Care & Hospice was conceptualized in 1994 by Carrolton Management, 
          	as a means to better serve their nursing home residents.  Since hospice care in nursing 
          	facilities was in its infancy, many of the Carrolton homes were unable to secure hospice 
          	services for their residents and families facing end of life issues.  In 1995 the Certificate 
          	of Need for providing Hospice services in Cumberland County was awarded to Community Home 
          	Care & Hospice.  Hospice was then available to the underserved population in nursing homes.  
          	However, good news travels fast and Community Home Care & Hospice very quickly began providing 
          	hospice for terminal patients in their homes as well as in the nursing facilities.  Community 
          	Home Care and Hospice continues to expand in services and geographically.</p>
          	<p>Through a passion for excellence and a commitment to patients and their families facing life
          	limiting illnesses, Community Home Care & Hospice now provides hospice care throughout eastern 
          	and central North Carolina through a network of local offices.  Community Home Care & Hospice 
          	is the largest provider of hospice services in North Carolina.</p>
